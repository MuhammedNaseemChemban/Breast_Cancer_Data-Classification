# Breast Cancer Data Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing breast cancer data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that could assist in understanding the disease and supporting decision-making in healthcare. The analysis aims to provide statistical insights and predictive modeling to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign.

### Data Exploration:

Understanding the distribution of features.

Identifying correlations between attributes.

Visualizing patterns in the data.

### Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values.

Normalizing/Scaling data for uniformity.

Feature selection and engineering.

### Model Development:

Building machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, etc.).

Evaluating models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

### Insights & Recommendations:

Providing actionable insights based on the analysis.

Recommending approaches for early detection and prevention.
